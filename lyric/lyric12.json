{"songStatus":1,"lyricVersion":5,"lyric":"(Verse)\nYou're walking, but no one seems to notice.\nLike a picture out of focus, but it looks clear to me.\nYou're talking, feeling like no ones listening.\nYou think you're not interesting, but I just don't agree.\nYou're the color showing through a world of black and white.\nI will always stand by you, cause I am on your side.\n(Chorus)\nIn my eyes, you're more than complete.\nYou're perfect to me,\nIf you could only see the way that you shine.\nIn my eyes, if there's one thing that's true,\nIt's that I believe in you.\nYou make the world look so bright\nAnd put a smile in my eyes.\nIn my eyes\nIn my eyes (put a smile in my eyes)\nIn my eyes\n(Verse)\nDo you see the sky is smiling?\nThere's no need for hiding.\nYou're all I want to see.\nI could spend a lifetime trying\nTo find the words describing\nWhat you are to me.\nYou're the color showing through\nA world of black and white.\nI will always stand by you,\nCause I am on your side.\n(Chorus)\nIn my eyes, you're more than complete.\nYou're perfect to me,\nIf you could only see the way that you shine.\nIn my eyes, if there's one thing that's true,\nIt's that I believe in you.\nYou make the world look so bright\nAnd put a smile in my eyes.\nIn my eyes\nIn my eyes (put a smile in my eyes)\nIn my eyes\n(Bridge)\nWhen all you see are the scars, all I see is your heart.\nYou're beautiful. You're beautiful the way that you are.\n(Chorus)\nIn my eyes, you're more than complete.\nYou're perfect to me,\nIf you could only see the way that you shine.\nIn my eyes, if there's one thing that's true,\nIt's that I believe in you.\nYou make the world look so bright\nAnd put a smile in my eyes.\nIn my eyes\nIn my eyes (put a smile in my eyes)\nIn my eyes\n","code":200}
